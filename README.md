FCEditor is a 3D Unity level editor for the 1998 PC game "Future Cop LAPD" that is currently under development.

Currently the features of the editor are:
- Creating/Editing custom geometry
- Creating/Editing custom textures
- Creating/Editing custom pathing
- Editing game objects position and rotation if applicable

What's currently planned for the editor is:
- Creating/Editing colored vertex
- Creating/Editing special tiles (animated, liquid, damaging)
- Creating custom game objects
- Creating custom models

And of course, improving and fixing the editor.

Please note that this editor is still very early in development and improvements will be made whenever they can be.
